# Purpose

This directory is created to train simple models, which in turn gather insights about the data at hand. Data is retrieved in the [data](../data/) directory.

# Structure

- [train.py](./train.py): Contains functions for train.ipynb
- [train.ipynb](./train.ipynb): Contains the main notebook for training models
- [test.ipynb](./test.ipynb): Contains testing scripts for Dao Xuan Tan when playing around with data. You don't need to care about this file.
